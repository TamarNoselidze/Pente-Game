                                            Pente for two players

The first player (with blue stones) begins the game and thereafter players take turns playing their stones, one at a time, on any empty intersection.
The stones are played on the intersections of the lines (excluding the edges of the board). Once played, a stone cannot be moved again, 
except when removed by a capture. The players take turns adding new stones to the board, building up their positions until one player wins, that is,
until one player has exactly 5 stones in horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction.

Captures: Stones are captured by flanking an adjacent pair of an opponent's stones directly on either side with your own stones. 
Captures consist of exactly two stones; flanking a single stone or three or more stones does not result in a capture. 


                                    Team Pente for four players

One team wins when:
    - One player gets five (or more) of his or her own stones in a row, just as in basic-two player Pente, or
    - The team captures 10 (or more) stones from their opponents.

The first player (with blue stones) makes a move and thereafter the players take turns, in a clockwise direction, placing their stones as in basic Pente.
Each player controls different colored stones and cooperates with his or her partner for a team win.

Captures: Normal captures and mixed captures are allowed. It is legal to capture your partner's stones. However, only those stones 
taken from your opponents count toward the winning total. You may not capture your own stones.
